This repository contains Python code and Raptor flowchart files for various programming concepts.

## Python Code Problems

The following programming concepts are demonstrated through Python code:

1. **Sequential**: A set of instructions executed in a linear order.
2. **Decision**: Conditional statements and branching based on logical conditions.
3. **Iterative**: Loops for repeating tasks multiple times.

## Raptor Flowchart Files

The corresponding Raptor flowcharts for the above concepts:

1. **Sequential**: Flowchart representing a sequence of steps.
2. **Decision**: Flowchart illustrating conditional decision-making.
3. **Iterative**: Flowchart depicting loops and repetition.
